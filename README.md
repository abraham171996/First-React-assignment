The Git repository contains a project that implements a checkout page for an online store. The page is built using React.js and styled with CSS modules for component-specific styling.

The project structure consists of multiple components:

App: The main component that serves as the entry point for the application. It includes the header, main content, and footer components.

Header: Renders the page header, displaying the title "Checkout".

Main: Contains the main content of the checkout page. It is divided into two sections: the left section for entering contact and shipping information and the right section for displaying the selected items and calculating the total price.

Left: Renders a form for entering contact and shipping information. It includes input fields for email, phone number, full name, address, city, country, and postal code. There is also an option to save the information for future use.

Right: Displays the selected items in the cart. It shows two items with their respective images, descriptions, prices, and quantity controls. The total price and shipping cost are calculated and displayed at the bottom.

Footer: Renders a simple footer with the creator's name and a link to their GitHub profile.

Each component has its own CSS module file that defines specific styles for that component.

The project aims to provide a functional and visually appealing checkout page for an online store. It can be used as a starting point for building an e-commerce application or as a reference for implementing similar functionality in React.js projects.

The repository offers a complete implementation of the checkout page, demonstrating the use of React components, modular CSS styling, and the separation of concerns. Developers can refer to the code and styles in the repository to understand how to build a checkout page or enhance their existing checkout process.
